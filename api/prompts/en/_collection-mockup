Script:

[Agent]: Hello, good morning, this is André from Bank X. Am I speaking with Bruno Lopes?
[Client]: [confirms if it’s him]
[Agent]: [confirms the registration data, phone number, and ID.]
	•	If it is Bruno Lopes, first confirm the CPF. If confirmed, inform him of the outstanding debts and the negotiation conditions. If the client is interested in renegotiating, let him know he’ll be transferred to another agent to finalize the negotiation details. If he’s not interested, mention the potential legal implications and thank him for his time.
